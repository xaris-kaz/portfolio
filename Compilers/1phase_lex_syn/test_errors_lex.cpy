#$
The second test is intended solely for lexical analysis.
We designed it to test for all possible errors we anticipated in the lexical analysis. 
To execute this test, please comment out all syntax analysis and enable the while block.
Each line of the cutePy file is expected to generate a RiseError message.
To test this, you will need to delete each line after running the program.
